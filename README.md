# TravelMoreBlogWebsite
TravelMore is a blog website that allows unregistered users to read other people's blogs about traveling. 
They can also create an account and post their own blogs. The posts can be edited and deleted by the author. 
Each blog has a comment section to allow registered users to express their opinions. 
The user can use the search bar to find blogs by the title. On the website users can also find tips for travelling and top destinations. 
Another functionality of the website is the “plan a trip” calculator. The user can enter the destination details like transport, accommodation, food and other costs to find the total cost for the trip. 
A “Contact Us” form is available for the users if they wish to get in touch. 

This project was created during my second year of studies in collaboration with my colleague Kira Nikitina. 
The main technologies used are Django, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap.
